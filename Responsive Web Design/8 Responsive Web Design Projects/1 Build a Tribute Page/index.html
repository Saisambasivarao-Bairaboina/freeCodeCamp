            Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an
            American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop",
            he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of
            the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers in the history
            of music. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion,
            along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in
            popular culture for over four decades.
          </p>

          <p>
            The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his
            professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito,
            Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson began his
            solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and rose to solo
            stardom with his fifth studio album Off the Wall (1979) during the
            peak of disco.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular
            music. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie
            Jean", and "Thriller" from his sixth studio album Thriller (1982),
            are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the
            medium into an art form and promotional tool. Their popularity
            helped propel Jackson and the television channel MTV into prominent
            highlights of 1980s pop culture. At the 26th Grammy Awards, Thriller
            won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards, including Album of the
            Year.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jackson continued to innovate with videos including "Leave Me Alone"
            and "Smooth Criminal" from Bad (1987), "Black or White" and
            "Remember the Time" from Dangerous (1991), "Scream" from HIStory:
            Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995) and "Ghosts" from the remix
            album Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix (1997). With
            songs such as "Man in the Mirror", "Black or White", "Heal the
            World", "Earth Song" and "They Don't Care About Us", Jackson's music
            emphasized racial integration, environmentalism and fighting against
            prejudice and injustice. Through stage and video performances, he
            popularized complicated dance techniques such as the moonwalk, to
            which he gave the name. His sound and style have influenced artists
            of various genres.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jackson was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1980 as a
            member of the Jacksons, and in 1984 as a solo artist. He also won
            the World Music Awards' Best-Selling Pop Male Artist of the
            Millennium, the American Music Award's Artist of the Century Award
            and the Bambi Pop Artist of the Millennium Award. He was inducted to
            the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997,
            and again as a solo artist in 2001. In 2002 he was added to the
            Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2010, Jackson was the first pop and
            rock 'n' roll performer inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame, and in
            2014 he was posthumously inducted into the Rhythm and Blues Music
            Hall of Fame.

            Jackson won hundreds of awards, more than any other popular music
            recording artist. His awards include many Guinness world records
            (eight in 2006 alone), including Most Successful Entertainer of All
            Time, 13 Grammy Awards the Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy
            Lifetime Achievement Award, and a record 26 American Music Awards
            (including the "Artist of the Century" and "Artist of the 1980s").
            13 number-one singles in the US in his solo career—more than any
            other male artist in the Hot 100 era and estimated sales of over 350
            million records worldwide making him one of the best-selling artists
            in music history.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jackson received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Fisk
            University in 1988. On December 29, 2009, the American Film
            Institute recognized Jackson's death as a "moment of significance".
          </p>

          <p>
            On June 25, 2009, less than three weeks before the first show was
            due to begin in London, with all concerts sold out, Jackson died
            from a cardiac arrest. Conrad Murray, his personal physician, had
            given Jackson various medications to help him sleep at his rented
            mansion in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles. Paramedics received a 911 call
            at 12:22 pm Pacific time (19:22 UTC), and arrived three minutes
            later. Jackson was not breathing and CPR was performed.
            Resuscitation efforts continued en route to Ronald Reagan UCLA
            Medical Center, and for more than an hour after arriving there, but
            were unsuccessful, and he was pronounced dead at 2:26 pm Pacific
            time (21:26 UTC).
          </p>

          <p>
            Jackson had taken propofol, lorazepam, and midazolam; his death was
            caused by a propofol overdose. News of his death spread quickly
            online, causing websites to slow down and crash from user overload,
            and putting unprecedented strain on services and websites including
            Google, AOL Instant Messenger, Twitter, and Wikipedia. Overall, web
            traffic rose by between 11% and 20%. MTV and BET aired marathons of
            Jackson's music videos. Jackson specials aired on television
            stations around the world. MTV briefly returned to its original
            music video format, and aired hours of Jackson's music videos, with
            live news specials featuring reactions from MTV personalities and
            other celebrities.
          </p>

          <p>
            Jackson's memorial was held on July 7, 2009, at the Staples Center
            in Los Angeles, preceded by a private family service at Forest Lawn
            Memorial Park's Hall of Liberty. Over 1.6 million fans applied for
            tickets to the memorial; the 8,750 recipients were drawn at random,
            and each received two tickets. The memorial service was one of the
            most watched events in streaming history, with an estimated US
            audience of 31.1 million.
